*1. The regression set of your application consists of 2000 tests. You
only have time for 200 test cases. Describe your course of action to
create a regression set of cases. Result: a document 1-2 pages with list
of your actions*

It’s important to understand which part of the application is affected
by the most recent changes, so that we can prioritize test effort. The
chances are higher the bug could be introduced either in the module
where the changes were made or depending on modules.

First, we need to break down the regression of 2000 test cases into test
suites, where each test suite includes a set of test cases that cover
separate pieces of functionality. Once this is done, we need to define
the test suites that cover the functionality of the affected and
dependent modules.

Second, we prioritize other test suites depending on the importance of
the functionality they cover, so that we can understand where most of
the testing effort has to be put.

Third, within each test suite we need to break down the test cases into
positive and negative.

The priority in selection is given to positive test cases because our
main goal is to ensure that application works as expected under normal
circumstances. To ensure that most crucial negative scenarios are
covered, it’s suggested to choose 1 negative test case for 5 positive
test cases within the suite.

Fourth, we prioritize test cases within the test suite. Test cases with
the highest priority are to be executed first, however we must not
forget about dependencies. In case the test case with the higher
priority depends on the test case with lower priority, then the test
case with lower priority must be executed first.

During the selection of test cases for the regression, we need to take
into account the test cases that failed during previous regression runs,
because chances are high they may fail again.

Once we understand the importance of test suites, test cases within test
suites and dependencies between test cases, it’s suggested that we
select 30% of test cases from the suites that are directly or indirectly
affected by the implemented changes, 20% from the suites that cover
crucial part of the functionality but not directly affected by the
changes, 10% of test cases from other test suites.
